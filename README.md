# Language-Translater-using-Seq2seq-Model
Language Translater using Seq-2-Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) architechture where LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) is used as memory blocks.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is particularly well-suited for sequential data and time-series analysis.
LSTMs were introduced to address some of the limitations of traditional RNNs, such as the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it challenging for RNNs to capture 
long-range dependencies in sequential data.

A sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model is a deep learning architecture commonly used for language translation tasks. This model takes a variable-length input sequence 
in one language and produces a corresponding variable-length output sequence in another language, making it ideal for translating sentences or documents.
Seq2seq models consist of an encoder and a decoder network, where the encoder processes the input sequence and compresses it into a fixed-size context vector, 
which is then used by the decoder to generate the target sequence. These models have been highly effective in machine translation tasks, as they can capture complex 
linguistic patterns and handle diverse vocabulary sizes, enabling seamless communication across different languages.

Certainly, here's a description of how the mentioned libraries can be used in a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) language translation model:

1. **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical operations in Python. In a seq2seq model, you can use NumPy to manipulate arrays and matrices,
   especially when processing and transforming text data.

2. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library. You can use it to load and preprocess language datasets, facilitating data cleaning, exploration,
   and transformation.

3. **Keras**: Keras is a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or other deep learning libraries. It simplifies the process of building
   neural networks. In your code, Keras is used to define the architecture of the seq2seq model, including layers like LSTM, Embedding, and Dense layers.

4. **Tokenization**: Tokenization is a crucial step in seq2seq models to convert text into a sequence of tokens or words. You can use the `Tokenizer` class
   from Keras's `keras.preprocessing.text` module to perform this task.

5. **ModelCheckpoint**: The `ModelCheckpoint` callback from Keras is used to save the model's weights during training. This is valuable for later use or for
    resuming training if needed.

6. **Pad Sequences**: The `pad_sequences` function from Keras preprocessing can be used to ensure that input sequences have the same length. In seq2seq models,
     this is essential as the model typically expects fixed-length sequences.

7. **Load Model**: The `load_model` function from Keras enables you to load pre-trained models or models saved during training, allowing you to use them for
    inference or further fine-tuning.

These libraries collectively enable you to build, train, and use seq2seq models for tasks like language translation. The specific code implementation would involve
integrating these libraries to load and preprocess data, define the model architecture, train the model, and then use it for translation tasks.
